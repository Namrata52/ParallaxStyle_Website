                There is a very famous quote by Hellen Keller, “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.”
                An adventure is something challenging, that takes us out of our ordinary lives and forces us to
                try new things. The definition of adventure varies from person to person. It can best be described as,
                “The risky undertaking of an unknown outcome, the result of which may also
                be dangerous or in favour.”
                <br><br>
                Adventure trips are all about making memories, gaining more knowledge, learning new things about
                the surroundings and about one's own self and making lots of great stories.
                Going for an adventure camp is the best way to get all
                of these as it forces one to get out of their ordinary lives and try new things.
